# Intro2EE4CAEE

There is a pervasive need to study the performance of built structures and their abilities to provide occupants with comfort in an efficient manner. The Internet of Things (IoT) provides methods of obtaining and studying data about our built environments. As such, these modules introduce civil, architectural, and environmental engineers to tropics of electrical engineering. Students will gather the abilities needed to program and deploy necessary sensors in the Internet of Things (IoT), as well as gain the ability to gather and analyze data collected.

## Get Started

These modules will each give you a small set of skills you'll need to get started working with sensors and data collection. Let's walk through them a bit to see what they look like:

### Module 1 - Basic Circuits and Elements

This module will give you a basic understanding of some of the common electrical components used in Electrical Engineering. After you've finished, you'll be able to know why we use capacitors, how to step down voltage using a voltage divider, and have a basic understanding of the role of an inductor.


### Module 2 - Introduction to Arduino

This module contains everything you need to get up and going with Arduino, the funny little computer that plays well with a lot of sensors and motors. There's also a really strong Arduino community online, which I would highly recommend if you get stuck or want to learn more. 
Say what the step will be

### Module 3 - Introduction to Programming

This segment will walk you through a number of different essential processes for building any program. After working through this module, you'll be able to control and interact with your Arduino in a much more comfortable way, with the ability to do some data processing.

### Module 4 - Data Acquisition & The Internet of Things

This system talks communication. It introduces you to a number of different comunication protocols used with sensors, the logic behind them, the pros and cons, and how to use them with your Arduino. After this module, you'll be able to construct a system capable of collecting light data, air quality data, laser data, you name it!
